This is a classic Snake Game developed using Python’s **turtle** graphics library. It’s a fun way to practice Python programming and basic game development concepts like collision detection, movement handling, and score tracking. The Snake Game involves controlling a snake on a 600x600 window, collecting food to grow longer, and avoiding collisions with the screen borders and its own body. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible before colliding with the borders or the snake’s body. The game features simple controls where you can use the **8**, **2**, **4**, and **6** keys to move the snake up, down, left, and right, respectively. Each time the snake eats food, it grows by one segment, and the game keeps track of both the current score and the highest score.

If the snake collides with the borders or its own body, the game resets. Additionally, the game speed increases slightly after each food item is eaten, providing dynamic difficulty. To play, you only need Python 3 and the **turtle** library, which comes pre-installed with Python. Simply clone or download the repository, run the `snake_game.py` file, and control the snake with the mentioned keys. The main game loop updates the screen, checks for collisions, and handles food collection, while the movement functions (`go_up()`, `go_down()`, `go_left()`, `go_right()`) change the snake’s direction based on user input.

Future improvements could include adding sound effects, implementing a pause feature, or creating different levels with varying difficulty. This project is open-source and free to use, and you are welcome to contribute or modify the game as you wish!
